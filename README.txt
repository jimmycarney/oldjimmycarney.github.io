Jimmy Carney

Correctly Implemented:
I have succesfully created all three html web pages with a 
css stylesheet (containing) more than five rules. All of these files
are in my jimmycarney.github.io repository, and I committed the files
often during the programming process. All of the html files and the css file
pass their respective validation tests. I also put an "index.html" file
in my public_html folder of my Tufts CS account that successfully redirects
to my actual website on GitHub.

Not Implementeed:
To the best of my knowledge, I have successfully implemented every aspect
of this assignment.

Collaboration:
I discussed how to redirect from Tufts CS account to the GitHub website with
Sinclair Meggitt.

Hours:
I spent approximately 5 hours completing this assignment.
