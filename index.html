			<p>Test paragraph: The main note that I have after doing the reading is actually a strength and a weakness of the chapter, and that is that the chapter assumes zero prior knowledge from the reader. For me, this was a weakness for the chapter when the author went into detail about periodic sounds. The author gave long descriptions for the different components of sine waves, and related many of these components to real-world examples. This provided the reader with the general knowledge necessary to understand the remainder of the chapter; however, I believe that the author spent far too much time on simple concepts with which most college students are already familiar. Even if some do need this reminder of how sine waves work, I think that reading the summary, on page 27, starting with "so, let's take stock to this point" would provide most college students with sufficient information to be able to comprehend the rest of the chapter.
